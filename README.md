Creator's Note:
This project was developed by me, Ethan Bourne. I knew how to play chess from a young age but did not know much
about the strategy until I decided to learn more in 2021. I am no expert in chess now, but I have learned the
fundamentals and occasionally watch high level games in my free time. My reason for creating this is because I
wanted to code a game myself and recreating chess offered a fun challenge for coding, as well as being a game I
personally enjoy.
